### Communities that GM together, stay together

At [Token Page](https://www.tokenpage.xyz), we absolutely love when people say GM - it really makes our day.

We realized over the last year that the communities that GM together stay together, and we found ourselves having more fun in these communities too. So we built GM!

It's super simple, just visit the page, connect your wallet and GM - that's it! ğŸ˜„

*But, why?*

Well, if you GM you're signalling to the world that you're still here and are in web3 for the vibes. Plus, you stand to win prizes!

*I'm worried about my security*

Firstly, we get it. Web3 is a bit of a cess-pool and it's hard to know who to trust. The good part is, actually, you shouldn't trust anyone, not even us. Whenever you try to connect to a website you should always be super careful because there are hundreds of ways you could be scammed.

For GM specifically, here's what you should be wary of - we will never ask you to sign a **transaction**, ever! We will only ask you to connect to your wallet and then sign a **message** to confirm you control the waller. If you don't know the difference between signing a transaction and signing a message just reach out to us, we're always super happy to show people exactly what it means.

If you don't even want to connect your wallet because it has all your best NFTs and you're super skeptical, we invite you to use **delegation**. It's a super easy way for you to allow one wallet to take non-transactional actions on behalf of another. So you could (e.g.) allow your hot wallet to say GM on your cold-wallets behalf. To use this just head over to [Delegate.Cash](https://delegate.cash) and use the app there. Once you've delegated a wallet, it will automatically work in GM ğŸš€

// ### The prizes

// Every day, one GM-er from the collection with the most GMs will win an NFT from our GM NFT collection.

// Holders of the GM tokens, will be exclusive access to [REDACTED]! (we're not quite ready to share yet, but keep your eyes peeled ğŸ‘€)

// Our GM tokens will be produced once a day and will be tradeable like all other NFTs. The artwork will be revealed in October and we are very excited to show it to you. It's going to be a generative PFP collection with some very unique features!

// ### How to win

// This is the easy part! When ever you GM (once a day max) you add a point to the daily score of each community you hold a token for.

// To get your community to the top you need to get everyone holding the token to come to the page and GM.

// If your community is at the top of the list at the end of the day (in the UTC timezone), one of the GM-ers from that collection will win the GM NFT ğŸ™Œ

// So the trick is: just get everyone from your community to come to the page and GM every day. If you are in many communities your best bet is to share it with all of them so that personally you are very likely to be in one of the communities that wins, thus increasing your odds of winning!

// If you have questions, feel free to reach out to us on twitter at [@tokenpagexyz](https://twitter.com/tokenpagexyz) ğŸ’¬

// **Good luck and GM frens!**
